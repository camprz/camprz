- 👋 Hi, I’m @camprz
- 👀 I’m interested in Graph Neural Networks applied to model liquids and multicomponent reactions using Deep Eutectic Solvents
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GNNs, KANs and Liquid Neural Networks
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on modelling reactions using neural networks but also in new architectures to obtain embeddings.
